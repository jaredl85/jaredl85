ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jared! I'm a recent graduate from the Nucamp full-stack web development bootcamp and I enjoy building beautiful and user-friendly web experiences.

ðŸ‘€ I'm currently looking for a junior developer role. I'm currently based in Seattle, but I'm willing to relocate to Portland, OR. Ideally, I would love to work an either partially or fully remote position.

ðŸŒ± I'm skilled in React, React Native, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Sass. I'm currently refreshing my skills with jQuery.
